<h1>Metropolis-Hastings with Approximate Acceptance Ratio Calculation</h1>
<h2>Yury Svirschevsky, Sergey Samsonov</h2>

<b>Abstract.</b> In this paper we introduce Approximate Metropolis-Hastings â€” a modification of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that uses an estimate of the proposal density when calculating acceptance probabilities instead of the exact density. This allows using proposals based on generative models with an intractable marginal likelihood, such as variational autoencoders. We provide a theoretical justification of the proposed algorithm using perturbation theory for Markov kernels and demonstrate its advantages using numerical experiments.
